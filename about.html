    <!-- AREAS OF LOW CONFIDENCE -->
    <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
      <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
      <p>
        One area I’m actively working on is <strong>time management under tight deadlines</strong>. Balancing speed
        and code quality has been challenging, but through HNG 13’s fast-paced environment, I’m learning to
        prioritize effectively, communicate early, and maintain composure while solving complex tasks.

        “Dear Future Me, keep building, keep learning, and never forget why you started. Every challenge you face
        sharpens your skills and brings you closer to mastery. Celebrate small wins and remain consistent.”

    <!-- EXTRA THOUGHTS -->
    <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
      <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        I believe that the combination of engineering discipline and tech innovation holds limitless potential
        for the future. The HNG Internship represents more than a learning experience—it’s a launchpad for global
        impact through collaboration, technology, and creativity.
